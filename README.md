# 🧪 Angular-Lab: Reusable Snippets & Setups

Welcome to my personal library of Angular configurations and features. This repository follows the **LIFT** principle and is designed for quick copy-pasting into new projects.

## 🚀 Setups (Project Configuration)
- **[ESLint Setup](./src/app/setups/eslint/README.md):** Strict "Bleeding Edge" rules for Signals and clean code.
- **[Vitest Setup](./src/app/setups/vitest/README.md):** Blazing fast unit testing configuration.

## 🎨 Features (Core Logic)
- **[Transloco i18n](./src/app/features/transloco/README.md):** Multi-language support with dynamic re-rendering.
- **[Dark/Light Theme](./src/app/features/theme/README.md):** Signal-based M3 theme management with persistence.

## 🛠 How to use
Each folder contains a `README.md` with:
1. Necessary `npm install` commands.
2. File placement instructions.
3. Integration snippets for `app.config.ts` or `styles.scss`.
